Burgers' Equation
==================

Burgers' Equation is a nonlinear hyperbolic equation. It has the same form as the advection equation, except that the quantity being advected is the velocity itself.

``Inviscid Burgers``
--------------------------------

A 2D Burgers' Equation has the following form:

.. math::

   u_t + u u_x + v u_y = 0\\
   v_t + u v_x + v v_y = 0

Here we have two 2D advection equations, where the x-velocity, :math:`u`, and y-velocity, :math:`v`, are the two quantities that we wish to advect with.

:py:mod:`pyro.burgers` is modified based on the :py:mod:`pyro.advection` with a different Riemann solver and timestep restriction.

Since velocity is no longer a constant, the timestep is now restricted to the each minimum velocity in each cell:

.. math::

   \Delta t < \min \left \{ \min \left \{ \frac{\Delta x}{|u_i|} \right \}, \min \left \{ \frac{\Delta y}{|v_i|}  \right \}  \right \}

The main difference of Burgers equation compared to the linear advection equation is the creation of shock and rarefactions due velocity been non-constant. This introduces a slightly different Riemann's problem which depends on shock speed by using the *Rankine-Hugoniot* jump condition.

The parameters for this solver are:

The figure above is generated using ``burgers/problems/test.py``, which is used to test the validity of the solver. Bottom-left of the domain has a higher velocity than the top-right domain. With :math:`u_{i,j}=v_{i,j}`, the wave travels diagonally to the top-right with a constant velocity that is equal to the shock speed. ``burgers/problem/verify.py`` can be used to calculate the wave speed using outputs from ``test.py`` and compare to the theoretical shock speed.
